SimpleAMM Smart Contract

Overview

SimpleAMM is a smart contract implementation of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) for decentralized token exchanges. It provides a basic example of how liquidity provision and token swapping work on a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform.

The key features of the SimpleAMM smart contract include:

Liquidity Pool Management: Users can add and remove liquidity to/from the pool for various token pairs.

Token Swapping: Users can exchange one token for another directly through the smart contract.

Reserves Management: The contract automatically adjusts reserves based on user trades to maintain liquidity.

Getting Started

To interact with the SimpleAMM smart contract, users can deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain using Remix IDE or similar development environments. They can then connect their Ethereum wallet to the deployed contract and begin testing its functionalities.


Features

Add Liquidity: Users can provide liquidity to the pool by depositing an equal value of two different tokens.

Remove Liquidity: Liquidity providers can withdraw their share of tokens from the pool, proportional to their contribution.

Token Swapping: Users can swap one token for another directly through the smart contract, based on available liquidity.

Reserves Management: The contract automatically adjusts reserves in liquidity pools based on user trades to maintain liquidity.

Usage

Deploy the SimpleAMM smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using Remix IDE.
Connect your Ethereum wallet to the deployed contract address.
Choose the desired action: adding liquidity, removing liquidity, or token swapping.
Follow the prompts and confirm the transaction using your wallet.
